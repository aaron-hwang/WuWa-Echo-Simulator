This is an in-progress Wuthering Waves Echo Simulator designed to simulate the rolling of Echoes in Wuthering Waves.

You can use the CSVs to perform data analytics for any purpose you would like. A GUI/Web app is also planned for the future.

To parse the CSVs, I recommend using the python library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

To download the exe, press the Releases button to the right and go from there. 

Credit goes to Low Priority for finding the data on substat values and distributions that were used for the sim. 

If you have any questions comments or concerns regarding the sim, message me on discord at `.ducc`. Try to make your message not look like an art scammer please.
