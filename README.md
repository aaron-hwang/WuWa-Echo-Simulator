This is an in-progress Wuthering Waves Echo Simulator designed to simulate the rolling of Echoes in Wuthering Waves.

You can use the CSVs to perform data analytics for any purpose you would like. A GUI/Web app is also planned for the future.

To parse the CSVs, I recommend using the python library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
